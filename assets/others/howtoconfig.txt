HOW TO COFIGURE THE SERVER:
1) Put license key and steam webapi key in server.cfg
2) Import es_extended.sql in your database
3) Start the server and have fun!

COMMON ISSUES:
a) Your server won't start when you press start.bat
	Try editing it with another path.

b) I have 2 huds when I install trew hud
	Go to C:\esx-sync-server\cfx-server-data-master\resources\[esx]\ex_extended\config.lua
	And change Config.Enablehud to false

Please report other issues!
