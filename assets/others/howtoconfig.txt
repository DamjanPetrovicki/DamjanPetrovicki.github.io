HOW TO COFIGURE THE SERVER:
1) Put license key and steam webapi key and set ur self as an admin in server.cfg
	1a) To get license key go to: https://keymaster.fivem.net/ and generate the key
	1b) If you didn't spend 5 dollars on STEAM, you CAN'T set the api key, so YOU DONT NEED IT
	1c) FOLLOW THIS STEP IF YOU SPENT 5 DOLLARS ON STEAM! To get ur hex id go to: http://vacbanned.com/ and in search bar paste your steam profile link and you will see 			there few rows, search for row where are 2 types of lines with numbers and letters, and find where it says HEX, copy that number left of that word and paste it 		in server config in 19th line (replace REPLACEME) with ur hex and in server console enter this `setgroup 1 superadmin` (if it gives you an error, change 1 to 2).
	1d) IF YOU DIDNT SPEND 5 DOLLARS ON STEAM FOLLOW THIS: Put the license key and import the sql to the database, then join the server and create a player, then close fivem             and go to phpmyadmin in table `users`, then you will see the first line with some numbers and letters (exmpl. F7SF8GS7F70ASF78DS8FS), copy that and paste it in 20th             line in server config, and comment the 19th line and in server console enter this `setgroup 1 superadmin` (if it gives you an error, change 1 to 2).
2) Import es_extended.sql in your database
3) Start the server and have fun!

COMMON ISSUES:
a) Your server won't start when you press start.bat
	Try editing it with another path.

b) I have 2 huds when I install trew hud
	Go to C:\esx-sync-server\cfx-server-data-master\resources\[esx]\ex_extended\config.lua
	And change Config.Enablehud to false
